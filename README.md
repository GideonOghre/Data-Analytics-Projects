# Data Analytics Projects
I am a Data Analyst who is a graduate of the University of Essex that studied Bsc Computer Science. I am proficient with multiple coding languages including Python and have hands-on experience with tools such as SQL, Power Bi, Excel, Tableau and Python Pandas. During my university dissertation I created an online voting system that used SQL to store and retrieve user questions and poll options, as well as sorting the data based on the userâ€™s preference. Machine Learning is a sector I have experience in using OpenCV to predict trends and computer vision to analyse visual data. I also have personal projects that allowed me to exercise my knowledge and experience with data analytics.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also well-versed in Agile methodologies and use tools such as Jira to manage and track tasks and projects. I understand the importance of clear and concise documentation and use Confluence to document processes and procedures. This helps ensure that all team members have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done.
